Domain and Email Linkification App
This app is a tool that allows you to identify valid domain names and email addresses in a text and automatically convert them into clickable links. The tool is designed to support universal acceptance of domain names and email addresses, and it was created as part of the Hackathon for Supporting Universal Acceptance of Domain Names and Email Addresses organized by tra.org.bh and icann.org.

Features
The app has the following features:

Identify valid domain names and email addresses in ASCII, Arabic script, and any other script supported by the Unicode.
Use the latest list of valid top-level domains, with the assumption that this list could be updated on a daily basis.
Use the Unicode scripts.txt file and the idna-tables-11.0.0.xml to identify valid characters for domain names.
Allow the user to change the input file and output file as desired by editing the constants.py file.
Save the updated version of the HTML webpage with the converted links.
Usage
To use the app, simply run the main.py file with the input file specified in the constants.py file. The app will scan the input file for domain names and email addresses and convert them into clickable links. The updated version of the HTML webpage will be saved to the output file specified in the constants.py file.
